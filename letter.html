  <h2>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</h2>

  <p>Dear Eileen,<br /><br />
  Thank you for your recent application to join
  us at the University of Awesome's Science
  Faculty to study as part of your PhD next year.
  I will answer your questions one by one, in the
  following sections.</p>

  <h2>Starting Dates</h2>

  <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your
  study with us at any time, however it would suit
  us better if you could start at the beginning 
  of a semester; the start dates for each one
  are as follows: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>First Semester: 9 September 2026</li>
    <li>Second Semester: 15 January 2027</li>
    <li>Third Semester: 2 May 2027</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know if this is okay, if so
  which start date would you prefer.</p>

  <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>

  <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty
  open minded facility- as long as the subjects fall
  somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
  You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher
  , and just the kind of person we'd like to have 
  on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you
  submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows,
  in order of priority:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the 
    health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk
    bass players at tempratures exceeding 30°C, when
    the audience size exponentially increases 
    (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to
    3 x 10<sup>4</sup>).
    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing 
    Musical scores</li>
  </ol>

  <p>So please can you provide more information
  on each of these subjects, including hiw ling you'd
  expect the research to take, required staff and
  other resources, and anything else you think
  we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

  <h2>Exotic Dance Moves</h2>

  <p> Yes you are right! As part of my post-doctorate
  work, I <em>did</em> study exotic stribal dances.
  To amswer your question, my favourite dances are as
  follows, with definitions:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Polynesian Chicken Dance</dt>
    <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential
    dance dating back as far as 300 BCE, a whole
    village would dance around in a circle like chickens,
    to encourage their luvestock to be "faithful".</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
