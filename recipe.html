  <h1>Quick Hummus Recipe</h1>

  <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number
   of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

  <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.
   It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>1 can of (400g) of chick peas (garbanxo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini </li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li> A dash of olive oil </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredientsinto a paste</li>
    <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time </li>
  </ol>


  <p>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander,
